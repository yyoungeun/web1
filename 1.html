<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="HTML_wiki">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup <strong> language</strong> for creating web pages
and<u> web</u> applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad
of cornerstone technologies for the <strong>World</strong> Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents
from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
<p style =" margin-top: 20px;">HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
appearance of the document. <u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.</p>
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
