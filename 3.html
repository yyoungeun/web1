<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),
  often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
  interpreted programming language that conforms to
  the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming
  language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed,
  prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of
  the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
  JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
  an essential part of web applications.
  The vast majority of websites use it,
  and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
  engine to execute it.
